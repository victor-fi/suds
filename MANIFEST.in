# Python 2 versions prior to some early 2.7.x release and Python 3 versions
# prior to some 3.2.x release had buggy disutils implementations that can
# result in our project's source distribution containing some extra unwanted
# files picked up from some of our local cache folders. This is a 3-layer fix
# to work around the problem:
#   1. We prune those folders just in case some of their content got added by
#      mistake.
#   2. An extra include is here to silence distutils warnings in case the used
#      distutils implementation is not buggy and therefore no extra files have
#      been added and distutils can not find anything to prune.
#   3. To make the include actually include an existing file, setup.py
#      constructs at least one such file to be included with a buggy distutils
#      implementation.

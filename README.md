# Overview

Suds is a lightweight SOAP-based web service client for Python
licensed under LGPL (see the `LICENSE.txt` file included in the
distribution).

Although the original `suds` package stopped releasing versions after `0.4`,
many (but not all) other open source projects moved to a maintained fork known
as "suds-jurko". This is a community fork of that fork that is releasing
packages under the main `suds` package name (and `suds-community` for
consistency until version 2.x of this package).

**Forked project information**

-   Project site - <https://github.com/suds-community/suds>
-   Official releases can be downloaded from:

distribution.

# Installation

Standard Python installation.

Here are the basic instructions for 3 different installation methods:

1.  Using `pip`
    -   Have the `pip` package installed.
    -   Run `pip install suds`.
2.  Using `easy-install`
    -   Have the `setuptools` package installed.
    -   Run `easy_install suds`.
3.  From sources
    -   Unpack the source package somewhere.
    -   Run `python setup.py install` from the source distribution\'s
        top level folder.

## Installation troubleshooting


-   Released prior to `0.7` have many known installation issues
    requiring the target Python environment to be manually prepared when
    using some ancient Python versions, e.g. 2.4, 2.5 or 3.1.
-   Releases `0.4.1. jurko 5 < x <= 0.6` may not be installed using
    `pip` into a Python environment with an already installed
    `setuptools` package older than the version expected by our project.
    Displayed error message includes instructions on how to manually
    upgrade the installed `setuptools` package before rerunning our
    installation.
    -   `pip` internally imports existing `setuptools` packages before
        running our setup, thus preventing us from upgrading the
        existing `setuptools` installation inplace.
-   If automated `setuptools` Python package installation fails (used in
    releases `0.4.1 jurko 5` and later), e.g. due to PyPI web site not
    being available, user might need to install it manually and then
    rerun the installation.
-   Releases prior to `0.4.1. jurko 5` will fail if the `distribute`
    Python package is not already installed on the system.
-   Python 2.4.3 on Windows has problems using automated `setuptools`
    Python package downloads via the HTTPS protocol, and therefore does
    not work correctly with PyPI which uses HTTPS links to all of its
    packages. The same does not occur when using Python version 2.4.4.

# Features

Basic features:

-   No class generation
-   Provides an object-like API.
-   Reads wsdl at runtime for encoding/decoding
-   Provides for the following SOAP (style) binding/encoding:
-   Document/Literal
-   RPC/Literal
-   RPC/Encoded (section 5)

The goal of suds is to present an RPC-like interface into
soap-based web services. This means that in most cases, users do not
need to be concerned with the complexities of the WSDL and referenced
schemas. Regardless of which soap message style is specified, the
signature of the service methods remain the same. Uses that do examine
the WSDL will notice that even with the document soap message
style, the signature of each method resembles an RPC. The method
signature contains the contents of the document defined for the
message instead of the document itself.

The primary interface into the library is the
`Client` object. It provides methods for configuring the library and (2)
sub-namespaces defined below. When the
`Client` is created, it processes the wsdl and referenced schema(s).
From this information, it derives a representation of this information
which is used to provide the user with a service description and
for message/reply processing.

## Python Support

See `.github/workflows/test_and_release.yml` for supported Python versions. The goal is to support
[currently maintained versions of Python](https://devguide.python.org/#status-of-python-branches).

## Logging

The suds package use the Python standard lib logging package:
all messages are at level DEBUG or ERROR.

To register a console handler you can use basicConfig:

```py
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
```

Once the console handler is configured, the user can enable module
specific debugging doing the following: logging.getLogger(\<desired
package\>).setLevel(logging.\<desired-level\>) A common example (show
sent/received soap messages):

```py
logging.getLogger('suds.client').setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
```

Suggested modules for debugging:
  * suds.client:: Set the logging level to DEBUG on this module to see soap messages (in & out) and http headers.
  * suds.transport:: Set the logging level to DEBUG on this module to see more details about soap messages (in& out) and http headers.
  * suds.xsd.schema:: Set the logging level to DEBUG on this module to see digestion of the schema(s).
  * suds.wsdl:: Set the logging level to `DEBUG` on this module to see digestion WSDL.

## Basic Usage

Version: API\^3\^

The `suds`
`Client` class provides a consolidated API for consuming web services.
The object contains (2) sub-namespaces:

__service__:: The
`service` namespace provides a proxy for the consumed service. This
object is used to invoke operations (methods) provided by the service
endpoint.

__factory__:: The
`factory` namespace provides a factory that may be used to create
instances of objects and types defined in the WSDL.

You will need to know the url for WSDL for each service used. Simply
create a client for that service as follows:

```py
from suds.client import Client
url = 'http://localhost:7080/webservices/WebServiceTestBean?wsdl'
client = Client(url)
```

You can inspect service object with: `__str()__` as follows to get a
list of methods provide by the service:

```py
print(client)

Suds - version: 0.3.3 build: (beta) R397-20081121

Service (WebServiceTestBeanService) tns="http://test.server.enterprise.rhq.org/"
   Prefixes (1):
     ns0 = "http://test.server.enterprise.rhq.org/"
   Ports (1):
     (Soap)
       Methods:
         addPerson(Person person, )
         echo(xs:string arg0, )
         getList(xs:string str, xs:int length, )
         getPercentBodyFat(xs:string name, xs:int height, xs:int weight)
         getPersonByName(Name name, )
         hello()
         testExceptions()
         testListArg(xs:string[] list, )
         testVoid()
         updatePerson(AnotherPerson person, name name, )
   Types (23):
     Person
     Name
     Phone
     AnotherPerson
```

note: See example of service with multiple ports below.

The sample output lists that the service named
`WebServiceTestBeanService` has methods such as
getPercentBodyFat() and addPerson().

#### Simple Arguments

Let\'s start with the simple example. The getPercentBodyFat() method has
the signature of getPercentBodyFat(`xs:string` name,
`xs:int` height, `xs:int` weight). In this case, the
parameters are `simple` types. That is, they not objects. This
method would be invoked as follows:

```py
result = client.service.getPercentBodyFat('jeff', 68, 170)
print(result)

You have 21% body fat.
```

```py
result = client.service.getPercentBodyFat(name='jeff', height=68, weight=170)
print(result)

You have 21% body fat.
```

```py
d = dict(name='jeff', height=68, weight=170)
result = client.service.getPercentBodyFat(**d)
print(result)

You have 21% body fat.
```

#### Complex Arguments

The addPerson() method takes a `person` argument of type:
`Person` and has a signature of: addPerson(`Person` person,
) where parameter type is printed followed by it\'s name. There is a
type (or class) named \'person\' which is coincidentally the same name
as the argument. Or in the case of getPercentBodyFat() the parameters
are __string__ of type xs:string and __integer__ of type xs:int.

So, to create a `Person` object to pass as an argument we need to
get a person argument using the `factory` sub-namespace as
follows:

```py
person = client.factory.create('Person')
print(person)

(Person)=
  {
    phone = []
    age = NONE
    name(Name) =
        {
            last = NONE
            first = NONE
        }
   }
```

As you can see, the object is created as defined by the WSDL. The list
of phone number is empty so we\'ll have to create a `Phone`
object:

```py
phone = client.factory.create('Phone')
phone.npa = 202
phone.nxx = 555
phone.number = 1212
```

\... and the name (Name object) and age need to be set and we need to
create a name object first:

```py
name = client.factory.create('Name')
name.first = 'Elmer'
name.last = 'Fudd'
```

Now, let\'s set the properties of our `Person` object

```py
person.name = name
person.age = 35
person.phone = [phone]
```

or

```py
person.phone.append(phone)

\... and invoke our method named addPerson() as follows:

```py
try:
   person_added = client.service.addPerson(person)
except WebFault as e:
  print(e)
```

It\'s that easy.

The ability to use python `dict` to represent complex objects was
re-introduced in 0.3.8. However, this is not the preferred
method because it may lead to passing incomplete objects. Also, this
approach has a significant limitation. Users may __not__ use python
`dict` for complex objects when they are subclasses (or
extensions) of types defined in the wsdl/schema. In other words, if the
schema defines a type to be an `Animal` and you wish to pass a
`Dog` (assumes Dog `isa` Animal), you may __not__ use a
`dict` to represent the dog. In this case, suds needs to set the
xsi:type=\"Dog\" but cannot because the python `dict` does not
provide enough information to indicate that it is a `Dog` not an
`Animal`. Most likely, the server will reject the request and
indicate that it cannot instantiate a abstract `Animal`.

#### Complex Arguments Using Python (dict)

Note: version 0.3.8+

Just like the factory example, let\'s assume the addPerson() method
takes a `person` argument of type: `Person`. So, to create a
`Person` object to pass as an argument we need to get a person
object and we can do so by creating a simple python `dict`.

```py
person = {}
```

According to the WSDL we know that the Person contains a list of Phone
objects so we\'ll need `dict`s for them as well.

```py
phone = {
    'npa':202,
    'nxx':555,
    'number':1212,
}
```

\... and the name (Name object) and age need to be set and we need to
create a name object first:

```py
name = {
    'first':'Elmer',
    'last':'Fudd'
}
```

Now, let\'s set the properties of our `Person` object

```py
person['name'] = name
person['age'] = 35
person['phone'] = [phone,]
```

\... and invoke our method named addPerson() as follows:

```py
try:
   person_added = client.service.addPerson(person)
except WebFault as e:
  print(e)
```

### Faults

The Client can be configured to throw web faults as `WebFault` or to
return a tuple (\<status\>, \<returned-value\>) instead as follows:

```py
client = client(url, faults=False)
result = client.service.addPerson(person)
print(result)

( 200, person ...)
```

### Options

The `suds`
`client` has many that may be used to control the behavior of the
library. Some are
`general options` and others are
`transport options`. Although, the options objects are exposed, the
preferred and supported way to set/unset options is through:

-   The `Client` constructor
-   The `Client`.set\_options()
-   The `Transport` constructor(s).

General options are as follows:

* faults:: Controls web fault behavior.
* service:: Controls the default service name for multi-service wsdls.
* port:: Controls the default service port for multi-port services.
* location:: This overrides the service port address URL defined in the WSDL.
* transport:: Controls the plugin web `transport`.
* cache:: Provides caching of documents and objects related to loading the WSDL. Soap envelopes are never cached.
* cachingpolicy:: The caching policy, determines how data is cached. The default is 0. version 0.4+
  - 0 = XML documents such as WSDL & XSD.
  - 1 = WSDL object graph.
* soapheaders:: Provides for soap headers.
* wsse:: Provides for WS-Security object. \
* __inject`:: Controls message/reply message injection.
* doctor:: The schema `doctor` specifies an object used to fix broken schema(s).
* xstq:: The XML schema type qualified flag indicates that `xsi:type` attribute __values__ should be qualified by namespace.
* prefixes:: Elements of the soap message should be qualified (when needed) using XML prefixes as opposed to xmlns=\"\" syntax.
* retxml:: Flag that causes the I{raw} soap envelope to be returned instead of the python object graph.
* autoblend:: Flag that ensures that the schema(s) defined
within the WSDL import each other.
* nosend:: Flag that causes suds to generate the soap envelope but not send it. Instead, a `RequestContext` is returned Default: False.
* sortnamespaces:: Flag that causes suds to sort namespaces alphabetically on storing them. Default: True.
* allowUnknownMessageParts:: Raise exceptions when unknown message parts  are detected when receiving a web service reply, compared to the operation's WSDL schema definition. Default: False.

**Transport options passed to the `Client` contructor are only used if the default transport is used**, they are as follows:

* proxy:: Controls http proxy settings.
* timeout:: The URL connection timeout (seconds) default=90. A timeout can also be set per method invocation.
* headers:: Provides for `extra` http headers.
* username:: username for HTTP authentication.
* password:: password for HTTP authentication.

### Custom behavior through swapping components

Various ways that suds behaves can be customized by swapping out custom

#### Initializing optional arrays with lists

In some unreleased versions of suds-jurko, all children elements were populated with empty lists. This was fixed in suds-community as a regression. This can be desired behavior as it simplifies constructing complex requests. To obtain the prior behavior, use a custom `Builder` class, for example:

```py
from suds.client import Client, Builder

class AlwaysInitializeBuilder(Builder):
    def skip_value(self, type):
        return False # always set value

client = Client(url)
client.factory.builder = AlwaysInitializeBuilder(client.factory.builder.resolver)
```

## Enumerations

Enumerations are handled as follows:

Let\'s say the wsdl defines the following enumeration:

```xml
<xs:simpleType name="resourceCategory">
  <xs:restriction base="xs:string">
    <xs:enumeration value="PLATFORM"/>
    <xs:enumeration value="SERVER"/>
    <xs:enumeration value="SERVICE"/>
  </xs:restriction>
</xs:simpleType>
```

The client can instantiate the enumeration so it can be used. Misspelled
references to elements of the `enum` will raise a `AttrError`
exception as:

```py
resourceCategory = client.factory.create('resourceCategory')
client.service.getResourceByCategory(resourceCategory.PLATFORM)
```

## Factory

The
`factory` is used to create complex objects defined the the wsdl/schema.
This is __not__ necessary for parameters or types that are specified
as `simple` types such as xs:string, xs:int, etc \...

The create() method should always be used becuase it returns objects
that already have the proper structure and schema-type information.
Since xsd supports nested type definition, so does create() using the
(.) dot notation. For example suppose the (Name) type was not defined as
a top level \"named\" type but rather defined within the (Person) type.
In this case creating a (Name) object would have to be quanified by
it\'s parent\'s name using the dot notation as follows:

```py
name = client.factory.create('Person.Name')
```

If the type is in the same namespace as the wsdl (targetNamespace) then
it may be referenced without any namespace qualification. If not, the
type must be qualifed by either a namespace prefix such as:

```py
name = client.factory.create('ns0:Person')
```

Or, the name can be fully qualified by the namespace itself using the
full qualification syntax as (as of 0.2.6):

```py
name = client.factory.create('{http://test.server.enterprise.rhq.org/}person')
```

Qualified names can only be used for the first part of the
name, when using (.) dot notation to specify a path.

## Services With Multiple Ports

Some services are defined with multiple ports as:

```xml
<wsdl:service name="BLZService">
  <wsdl:port name="soap" binding="tns:BLZServiceSOAP11Binding">
    <soap:address location="http://www.thomas-bayer.com:80/axis2/services/BLZService"/>
  </wsdl:port>
  <wsdl:port name="soap12" binding="tns:BLZServiceSOAP12Binding">
    <soap12:address location="http://www.thomas-bayer.com:80/axis2/services/BLZService"/>
</wsdl:service>
```

And are reported by suds as:

```py
url = 'http://www.thomas-bayer.com/axis2/services/BLZService?wsdl'
client = Client(url)
print(client)

Suds - version: 0.3.3 build: (beta) R397-20081121

Service (BLZService) tns="http://thomas-bayer.com/blz/"
   Prefixes (1)
     ns0 = "http://thomas-bayer.com/blz/"
   Ports (2):
     (soap)
       Methods (1):
         getBank(xs:string blz, )
     (soap12)
       Methods (1):
         getBank(xs:string blz, )
   Types (5):
      getBankType
      getBankResponseType
      getBankType
      getBankResponseType
      detailsType
```

This example only has (1) method defined for each port but it could very
likely have may methods defined. Suds does not require the method
invocation to be qualifed (as shown above) by the port as:

```py
client.service.<port>.getBank()
```

unless the user wants to specify a particular port. In most cases, the
server will work properly with any of the soap ports. However, if you
want to invoke the getBank() method on this service the user may qualify
the method name with the port.

There are (2) ways to do this:

-   Select a default port using the `port`
    `    option` before invoking the method as:

<!-- -->

```py
client.set_options(port='soap')
client.service.getBank()
```

-   fully qualify the method as:

<!-- -->

```py
client.service.soap.getBank()
```

**After r551 version 0.3.7, this changes some to support
multiple-services within (1) WSDL as follows:**

This example only has (1) method defined for each port but it could very
likely have may methods defined. Suds does not require the method
invocation to be qualifed (as shown above) by the port as:

```py
client.service[port].getBank()
```

unless the user wants to specify a particular port. In most cases, the
server will work properly with any of the soap ports. However, if you
want to invoke the getBank() method on this service the user may qualify
the method name with the port. The `port` may be subscripted
either by name (string) or index(int).

There are many ways to do this:

-   Select a default port using the `port`
    `    option` before invoking the method as:

<!-- -->

```py
client.set_options(port='soap')
client.service.getBank()
```

-   fully qualify the method using the port `name` as:

<!-- -->

```py
client.service['soap'].getBank()
```

-   fully qualify the method using the port `index` as:

<!-- -->

```py
client.service[0].getBank()
```

## WSDL With Multiple Services & Multiple Ports

version: 0.3.7+

Some WSDLs define multiple services which may (or may not) be defined
with multiple ports as:

```xml
<wsdl:service name="BLZService">
  <wsdl:port name="soap" binding="tns:BLZServiceSOAP11Binding">
    <soap:address location="http://www.thomas-bayer.com:80/axis2/services/BLZService"/>
  </wsdl:port>
  <wsdl:port name="soap12" binding="tns:BLZServiceSOAP12Binding">
    <soap12:address location="http://www.thomas-bayer.com:80/axis2/services/BLZService"/>
</wsdl:service>
<wsdl:service name="OtherBLZService">
  <wsdl:port name="soap" binding="tns:OtherBLZServiceSOAP11Binding">
    <soap:address location="http://www.thomas-bayer.com:80/axis2/services/OtherBLZService"/>
  </wsdl:port>
  <wsdl:port name="soap12" binding="tns:OtherBLZServiceSOAP12Binding">
    <soap12:address location="http://www.thomas-bayer.com:80/axis2/services/OtherBLZService"/>
</wsdl:service>
```

And are reported by suds as:

```py
url = 'http://www.thomas-bayer.com/axis2/services/BLZService?wsdl'
client = Client(url)
print(client)

Suds - version: 0.3.7 build: (beta) R550-20090820

Service (BLZService) tns="http://thomas-bayer.com/blz/"

     (soap12)
       Methods (1):
         getBank(xs:string blz, )
   Types (5):
      getBankType

       Methods (1):
         getBank(xs:string blz, )
   Types (5):
      getBankType
      getBankResponseType
      getBankType
      getBankResponseType
      detailsType
```

This example only has (1) method defined for each port but it could very
likely have may methods defined. Suds does __not__ require the
method invocation to be qualifed (as shown above) by the service and/or
port as:

```py
client.service[service][port].getBank()
```

unless the user wants to specify a particular service and/or port. In
most cases, the server will work properly with any of the soap ports.
However, if you want to invoke the getBank() method on the
`OtherBLZService` service the user may qualify the method name
with the service and/or port. If not specified, suds will default the
service to the 1st server defined in the WSDL and default to the 1st
port within each service. Also, when a WSDL defines (1) services, the
\[` subscript is applied to the port selection. This may be a little
confusing because the syntax for subscripting can seem inconsistent.
Both the `service` __and__ `port` may be subscripted
either by name (string) or index (int).

There are many ways to do this:

-   Select a default service using the `service` option and
    default port using `port` option
    `    option` before invoking the method as:

<!-- -->

```py
client.set_options(service='OtherBLZService', port='soap')
client.service.getBank()
```

-   method qualified by `service` and `port` as:

<!-- -->

```py
client.service['OtherBLZService']['soap'].getBank()
```

-   method qualified by `service` and `port` using indexes
    as:

<!-- -->

```py
client.service[1][0].getBank()
```

-   method qualified by `service` (by name) only as:

<!-- -->

```py
client.service['OtherBLZService'].getBank()
```

-   method qualified by `service` (by index) only as:

<!-- -->

```py
client.service[1].getBank()
```

Note, that if a WSDL defines more then one service, you __must__
qualify the `service` via
`option` or by using the subscripting syntax in order to specify the
`port` using the subscript syntax.

## SOAP Headers

SOAP headers may be passed during the service invocation by using the
`soapheaders` `option` as follows:

```py
client = client(url)
token = client.factory.create('AuthToken')
token.username = 'Elvis'
token.password = 'TheKing'
client.set_options(soapheaders=token)
result = client.service.addPerson(person)
```

OR

```py
client = client(url)
userid = client.factory.create('Auth.UserID')
userid.set('Elvis')
password = client.factory.create('Auth.Password')
password.set('TheKing')
client.set_options(soapheaders=(userid,password))
result = client.service.addPerson(person)
```

OR

```py
client = client(url)
userid = 'Elmer'
passwd = 'Fudd'
client.set_options(soapheaders=(userid,password))
result = client.service.addPerson(person)
```

The `soapheaders` option may also be assigned a dictionary for
those cases when optional headers are specified and users don\'t want to
pass None place holders. This works much like the method parameters. Eg:

```py
client = client(url)
myheaders = dict(userid='Elmer', passwd='Fudd')
client.set_options(soapheaders=myheaders)
result = client.service.addPerson(person)
```

Passing `soapheaders` by keyword (dict) is available in 0.3.4
(r442) and later.

## Custom SOAP Headers

Custom SOAP headers may be passed during the service invocation by using
the `soapheaders`
`option`. A `custom` soap header is defined as a header that is
required by the service by __not__ defined in the wsdl. Thus, the
`easy` method of passing soap headers already described cannot be
used. This is done by constructing and passing an
`Element` or collection of
`Elements` as follows:

```py
from suds.sax.element import Element
client = client(url)
ssnns = ('ssn', 'http://namespaces/sessionid')
ssn = Element('SessionID', ns=ssnns).setText('123')
client.set_options(soapheaders=ssn)
result = client.service.addPerson(person)
```

Do __not__ try to pass the header as an XML `string` such as:

```py
client = client(url)
ssn = '<ssn:SessionID>123</ssn:SessionID>'
client.set_options(soapheaders=ssn)
result = client.service.addPerson(person)
```

It will not work because: 1. Only
`Elements` are processed as `custom` headers. 1. The XML string
would be escaped as &lt;ssn:SessionID&gt;123&lt;/ssn:SessionID&gt;
anyway.

\*Notes: 1. Passing single
`Elements` as soap headers fixed in Ticket \#232 (r533) and will be
released on 0.3.7. 1. Reusing this
`Element` in subsequent calls fixed in Ticket \#233 (r533) and will be
released on 0.3.7.

## WS-SECURITY

As of r452 / 0.3.4 (beta) to provide basic ws-security with
`UsernameToken` with `clear-text` password (no digest).

```py
from suds.wsse import *
security = Security()
token = UsernameToken('myusername', 'mypassword')
security.tokens.append(token)
client.set_options(wsse=security)
```

or, if the `Nonce` and `Create` elements are needed, they
can be generated and set as follows:

```py
from suds.wsse import *
security = Security()
token = UsernameToken('myusername', 'mypassword')
token.setnonce()
token.setcreated()
token.setnonceencoding(True)
token.setpassworddigest('digest')
security.tokens.append(token)
client.set_options(wsse=security)
```

but, if you want to manually set the `Nonce` and/or
`Created`, you may do as follows:

```py
from suds.wsse import *
security = Security()
token = UsernameToken('myusername', 'mypassword')
token.setnonce('MyNonceString...')
token.setcreated(datetime.now())
security.tokens.append(token)
client.set_options(wsse=security)
```

## Multi-document (Document/Literal)

In most cases, services defined using the document/literal SOAP binding
style will define a single document as the message payload. The
\<message/\> will only have (1) \<part/\> which references an
\<element/\> in the schema. In this case, suds presents a RPC view of
that method by displaying the method signature as the contents (nodes)
of the document. Eg:

```xml
<schema>
...
<xs:element name="Foo" type = "tns:Foo"/>
<xs:complexType name="Foo">
  <xs:sequence>
    <xs:element name="name" type="xs:string"/>
    <xs:element name="age" type="xs:int"/>
  </xs:sequence>
</xs:complexType>
...
</schema>

<definitions>
...
<message name="FooMessage">
  <part name="parameters" element="Foo">
</message>
...
</definitions>
```

Suds will report the method `foo` signature as:

    foo(xs:string name, xs:int age,)

This provides an RPC feel to the document/literal soap binding style.

Now, if the wsdl defines:

```xml
<schema>
...
<xs:element name="Foo" type = "tns:Foo"/>
<xs:element name="Bar" type = "xs:string"/>
<xs:complexType name="Foo">
  <xs:sequence>
    <xs:element name="name" type="xs:string"/>
    <xs:element name="age" type="xs:int"/>
  </xs:sequence>
</xs:complexType>
...
</schema>

<definitions>
...
<message name="FooMessage">
  <part name="foo" element="Foo">
  <part name="bar" element="Bar">
</message>
...
</definitions>
```

Suds will be forced to report the method `foo` signature as:

    foo(Foo foo, xs:int bar)

The message has (2) parts which defines that the message payload
contains (2) documents. In this case, suds must present a /Document/
view of the method.

## HTTP Authentication

#### Basic

As of version 0.3.3 and newer, `basic` HTTP authentication
as defined by [RFC-2617](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2617.txt) can be
done as follows:

```py
client = Client(url, username='elmer', password='fudd')
```

Authentication is provided by the (default)
`HttpAuthenticated` `Transport` class defined in the
`transport.https` module that follows the challenge (http 401) /
response model defined in the RFC.

As of r537, `0.3.7` beta, a new `Transport` was added in the
`transport.http` module that provides http authentication for servers
that don\'t follow the challenge/response model. Rather, it sets the
`Authentication:` http header on __all__ http requests. This
transport can be used as follows:

```py
from suds.transport.http import HttpAuthenticated
t = HttpAuthenticated(username='elmer', password='fudd')
client = Client(url, transport=t)
```

Or

```py
from suds.transport.http import HttpAuthenticated
t = HttpAuthenticated()
client = Client(url, transport=t, username='elmer', password='fudd')
```

For version: 0.3.3 and older ONLY:

Revision 63+ (and release 0.1.8+) includes the migration from httplib to
urllib2 in the suds default
`transport` which enables users to leverage all of the authentication
features provided by urllib2. For example basic HTTP authentication
could be implemented as follows:

```py
myurl = 'http://localhost:7080/webservices/WebServiceTestBean?wsdl'
client = Client(myurl)

import urllib2
baseurl = 'http://localhost:7080/'
username = 'myuser'
password = 'mypassword'
passman = urllib2.HTTPPasswordMgrWithDefaultRealm()
passman.add_password(None, baseurl, username, password)
authhandler = urllib2.HTTPBasicAuthHandler(passman)

client.options.transport.urlopener  = urllib2.build_opener(authhandler)
```

The suds default
`HTTP transport` uses urllib2.urlopen(), basic http authentication is
handled automatically if you create the transport\'s urlopener correctly
and set the urlopener.

#### Windows (NTLM)

As of 0.3.8, suds includes a
`NTLM transport` based on urllib2. This implementation requires
`users to install the [python-ntlm](http://code.google.com/p/python-ntlm/). It is __not__ packaged with suds.

To use this, simply do something like:

```py
from suds.transport.https import WindowsHttpAuthenticated
ntlm = WindowsHttpAuthenticated(username='xx', password='xx')
client = Client(url, transport=ntlm)
```

## Proxies

The suds default
`transport` handles proxies using urllib2.Request.set\_proxy(). The
proxy options can be passed set using Client.set\_options. The proxy
options must contain a dictionary where keys=protocols and values are
the hostname (or IP) and port of the proxy.

```py
...
d = dict(http='host:80', https='host:443', ...)
client.set_options(proxy=d)
...
```

## Message Injection  (Diagnostics/Testing)

The service API provides for message/reply injection.

To inject either a soap message to be sent or to inject a reply or fault
to be processed as if returned by the soap server, simply specify the
`__inject` keyword argument with a value of a dictionary
containing either:

-   msg = \<message string\>
-   reply = \<reply string\>
-   fault = \<fault string\>

when invoking the service. Eg:

Sending a raw soap message:

```py
message = \
"""<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<SOAP-ENV:Envelope>
    <SOAP-ENV:Body>
        ...
    </SOAP-ENV:Body>
</SOAP-ENV:Envelope>"""

print(client.service.test(__inject={'msg':message}))
```

Injecting a response for testing:

```py
reply = \
"""<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<SOAP-ENV:Envelope>
    <SOAP-ENV:Body>
        ...
    </SOAP-ENV:Body>
</SOAP-ENV:Envelope>"""

print(client.service.test(__inject={'reply':reply}))
```

## SSL certificate verification & Custom Certificates

With Python 2.7.9, SSL/TLS verification is turned on by default.

This can be a problem when suds is used against an endpoint which has a self-signed certificate, which is quite common in the corporate intranet world.

One approach to turn off certificate validation in suds is to use a custom transport class. For example in Python 3:

```py
import urllib.request
import ssl
import suds.transport.http

class UnverifiedHttpsTransport(suds.transport.http.HttpTransport):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super(UnverifiedHttpsTransport, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)

    def u2handlers(self):
        handlers = super(UnverifiedHttpsTransport, self).u2handlers()
        context = ssl.create_default_context()
        context.check_hostname = False
        context.verify_mode = ssl.CERT_NONE
        handlers.append(urllib.request.HTTPSHandler(context=context))
        return handlers

client = Client(url, transport=UnverifiedHttpsTransport())

```

In addition, if a custom set of certificates and/or root CA is needed, this can also be done via a custom transport class. For example, in Python 3:

```py
class ClientHttpsTransport(HttpTransport):
    def __init__(self, certfile, keyfile, cafile, *args, **kwargs):
        super(ClientHttpsTransport, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self.certfile = certfile
        self.keyfile = keyfile
        self.cafile = cafile

    def u2handlers(self):
        handlers = super(ClientHttpsTransport, self).u2handlers()
        context = ssl.create_default_context(ssl.Purpose.SERVER_AUTH, cafile=self.cafile)
        context.load_cert_chain(self.certfile, self.keyfile)
        context.check_hostname = False
        context.verify_mode = ssl.CERT_NONE
        handlers.append(urllib.request.HTTPSHandler(context=context))
        return handlers

custom_https = ClientHttpsTransport('/path/to/certificate_file', '/path/to/key_file', '/path/to/ca_file')

client = Client(url, transport=custom_https),
```

## Timeouts

Per request timeouts can be set by using a `__timeout` keyword argument in
each call. This supersedes the global client default. For example, the
following call will have a timeout of 10 seconds:


```python
client = Client(url, timeout=30)
client.service.test(__timeout=10)
```

## Performance

As of 0.3.5 r473, suds provides some URL caching. By default, http
get(s) such as getting the WSDL and importing XSDs are cached. The
caching applies to URL such as those used to get the referenced WSDLs
and XSD schemas but does __not__ apply to service method invocation
as this would not make sense.

In 0.3.9, `FileCache` was replaced with `ObjectCache`.

The default cache is a
`ObjectCache` with an expiration of (1) day.

This duration may be adjusted as follows:

```py
import datetime
 ...
cache = client.options.cache
cache.duration = datetime.timedelta(days=10)
```

The duration must be a `datetime.timedelta`.

The default location (directory) is /tmp/suds so
Windows users will need to set the location to something
that makes sense on windows.

The cache is an
`option` and can be set with any kind of
`Cache` object or may be disabled by setting the option to None.
So, uses may plug-in any kind of cache they want.

```py
from suds.cache import Cache
class MyCache(Cache)
 ...
client.set_options(cache=MyCache())
```

To disable caching:

```py
client.set_options(cache=None)
```

## Fixing Broken Schema(s)

There are many cases where the schema(s) defined both within the WSDL or
imported are broken. The most common problem is failure to import the
follow proper import rules. That is, references are made in one schema
to named objects defined in another schema without importing it. The
`doctor` module defines a set of classes for mending broken
schema(s).

### Doctors

The
`Doctor` class provides the interface for classes that provide this
service. Once defined, the doctor can be specified using the
schema doctor as an
`option` when creating the Client. Or, you can use one of the stock
doctors

-   `    ImportDoctor` - Used to fix import problems. For example:

<!-- -->

```py
imp = Import('http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/')
imp.filter.add('http://some/namespace/A')
imp.filter.add('http://some/namespace/B')
doctor = ImportDoctor(imp)
client = Client(url, doctor=doctor)
```

In this example, we\'ve specified that the doctor should examine
schema(s) with a targetNamespace of
`http://some/namespace/A or http://some/namespace/B` and ensure that the
schema for the `http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/` is imported.
If those schema(s) do not have an \<xs:import/\> for those namespaces,
it is added.

For cases where the schemaLocation is not bound to the
namespace, the
`Import` can be created specifying the location has follows:

```py
imp = Import('http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema', location='http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema.xsd')
imp.filter.add('http://some/namespace/A')
imp.filter.add('http://some/namespace/B')
doctor = ImportDoctor(imp)
client = Client(url, doctor=doctor)
```

A commonly referenced schema (that is not imported) is the SOAP section
5 encoding schema. This can now be fixed as follows:

```py
imp = Import('http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/')
imp.filter.add('http://some/namespace/A')
doctor = ImportDoctor(imp)
client = Client(url, doctor=doctor)
```

note: Available in r512+ and 0.3.6 `beta`.

### Binding Schema Locations (URL) to Namespaces

Some WSDL(s) schemas import as: \<import
namespace=\"<http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/%22/>\> without
schemaLocation=\"\" and expect processor to use the namespace URI as the
schema location for the namespace. The specifications for processing
\<import/\> leave the resolution of the imported namespace to a schema
to the descession of the processor (in this case suds) when
\@schemaLocation is not specified. Suds always looks within the WSDL for
a schema but does not look outside unless:

-   A schemaLocation is specified, or
-   A static binding is specified using the following syntax:

<!-- -->

```py
from suds.xsd.sxbasic import Import
ns = 'http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/'
location = 'http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/'
Import.bind(ns, location)
```

Or, the shorthand (when location is the same as the namespace URI)

```py
Import.bind(ns)
```

note: `http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/'`
automatically `bound` in 0.3.4 as of (r420).

## Plugins

New in 0.4 is a plugin facility. It is intended to be a general, more
extensible, mechanism for users to inspect/modify suds while it is
running. Today, there are two `one-off` ways to do this:

1\. bindings.Binding.replyfilter - The reply text can be inspected &
modified. 2. xsd.Doctor - The doctor `option` used to mend broken
schemas.

The `plugin` module provides a number of classes but users really only need
to be concerned with a few:

-   The `Plugin` class which defines the interface for user plugins
-   The `Context` classes which are passed to the plugin.

The plugins are divided into (4) classes based on the `tasks` of
the soap client:

`Initialization` :: The client initialization task which is when
the client has digested the WSDL and associated XSD. `Document
Loading` :: The document loading task. This is when the client is
loading WSDL & XSD documents. `Messaging` :: The messaging task is
when the client is doing soap messaging as part of method (operation)
invocation.

#### InitPlugin

The `InitPlugin` currently has (1) hook:

`initialized()` :: Called after the client is initialized. The
context contains the `WSDL` object.

#### DocumentPlugin

The `DocumentPlugin` currently has (2) hooks::

`loaded()` :: Called before parsing a `WSDL` or `XSD`
document. The context contains the url & document text.

`parsed()` :: Called after parsing a `WSDL` or `XSD`
document. The context contains the url & document `root`.

#### MessagePlugin

The `MessagePlugin` currently has (5) hooks ::

* `marshalled()` :: Provides the plugin with the opportunity to inspect/modify the envelope Document __before__ it is sent.
* `sending()` :: Provides the plugin with the opportunity to inspect/modify the message text __before__ it is sent.
* `received()` :: Provides the plugin with the opportunity to inspect/modify the received XML text __before__ it is SAX parsed.
* `parsed()` :: Provides the plugin with the opportunity to inspect/modify the sax parsed DOM tree for the reply __before__ it is unmarshalled.
* `unmarshalled()` :: Provides the plugin with the opportunity to inspect/modify the unmarshalled reply __before__ it is returned to the caller.

General usage:

```py
from suds.plugin import *

class MyPlugin(DocumentPlugin):
        ...

plugin = MyPlugin()
client = Client(url, plugins=[plugin])
```

Plugins need to override __only__ those methods (hooks) of interest
- not all of them. Exceptions are caught and logged.

Here is an example. Say I want to add some attributes to the document
root element in the soap envelope. Currently suds does not provide a way
to do this using the main API. Using a plugin much like the schema
doctor, we can do this.

Say our envelope is being generated by suds as:

```xml
<soapenv:Envelope>
  <soapenv:Body>
    <ns0:foo>
      <name>Elmer Fudd</name>
      <age>55</age>
    </ns0:foo>
  </soapenv:Body>
</soapenv:Envelope>
```

But what you need is:

```xml
<soapenv:Envelope>
  <soapenv:Body>
    <ns0:foo id="1234" version="2.0">
      <name>Elmer Fudd</name>
      <age>55</age>
    </ns0:foo>
  </soapenv:Body>
</soapenv:Envelope>
```

```py
from suds.plugin import MessagePlugin

class MyPlugin(MessagePlugin):
    def marshalled(self, context):
        body = context.envelope.getChild('Body')
        foo = body[0]
        foo.set('id', '12345')
        foo.set('version', '2.0')

client = Client(url, plugins=[MyPlugin()])
```

In the future, the `Binding.replyfilter` and `doctor`
__option__ will likely be deprecated. The
`ImportDoctor` has been extended to implement the
`Plugin`.onLoad() API.

In doing this, we can treat the `ImportDoctor` as a plugin:

```py
imp = Import('http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema')
imp.filter.add('http://webservices.serviceU.com/')
d = ImportDoctor(imp)
client = Client(url, plugins=[d])
```

We can also replace our Binding.replyfilter() with a plugin as follows:

```py
def myfilter(reply):
  return reply[1:]

Binding.replyfilter = myfilter

# replace with:

class Filter(MessagePlugin):
    def received(self, context):
        reply = context.reply
        context.reply = reply[1:]

client = Client(url, plugins=[Filter()])
```

## Technical (FYI) Notes

-   XML namespaces are represented as a tuple (prefix, URI). The default
    namespace is (None,None).
-   The suds.sax module was written becuase elementtree and other python
    XML packages either: have a DOM API which is very unfriendly or: (in
    the case of elementtree) do not deal with namespaces and especially
    prefixes sufficiently.
-   A qualified reference is a type that is referenced in the WSDL such
    as \<tag type=\"tns:Person/\> where the qualified reference is a
    tuple (\'Person\', (\'tns\',\'<http://myservce/namespace>\')) where
    the namespace is the 2nd part of the tuple. When a prefix is not
    supplied as in \<tag type=\"Person/\>, the namespace is the
    targetNamespace for the defining fragment. This ensures that all
    lookups and comparisons are fully qualified.
